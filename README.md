# E_ROT
A software to design and run visuo-motor reaching tasks, programmed in Matlab.

Each programmed task has its own function and GUI, plus a GUI to run experiments that can combine different blocks and tasks. 
Each task will have an output, saved automatically in a folder relative to the Subject and the Block that has been run.

This program is meant to be used with a NETStation to record EEG signals. The EEG recording starts automatically at the 
beginning of a new block and stops at the end of the block, but can also be started and stopped at the experimenterâ€™s 
discretion directly from the GUI. Each function is programmed to automatically send an event on target activation.
The program is intended to run on a Mac and cannot run on anything else with the current settings without some modifications, 
but it would be possible to adapt it fairly easily.

See E_ROT_Manual for a more in depth explanation.
