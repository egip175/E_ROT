# E_ROT
A software to design and run visuo-motor reaching tasks, programmed in Matlab.

Each programmed task has its own function and GUI, plus a GUI to run experiments that can combine different blocks and tasks. 
Each task has an output, saved automatically in a folder relative to the Subject and the Block that has been run. The MotorTask acquires the cursor position on the screen with relative timestamp.

The program as it's written is intended to run on a Mac and cannot run on anything else with the current settings without some modifications, but it would be possible to adapt it fairly easily (see manual).

This program is meant to be used with a NETStation to record EEG signals, although it can be used without utilizing this option. The EEG recording is programmed to start automatically at the beginning of a new block and stops at the end of the block, but can also be started and stopped at the experimenterâ€™s discretion directly from the GUI. Each function is programmed to automatically send an event on target activation.

See E_ROT_Manual for a more in depth explanation of the software.

NB: Currently, the MEM and VIS task are under revision and shouldn't be used with the expGUI since there could be unexpected results.
